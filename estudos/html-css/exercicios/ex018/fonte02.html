    <h1>Starman</h1>
    <p>Hey, now, now <br />Goodbye, love</p>
    <p>
      Didn't know what time it was, the lights were low I leaned back on my
      radio <br />Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll <br />
      Lotta soul, he said
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the loud sound did seem to fade <br />
      Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase <br />
      That weren't no DJ, that was hazy cosmic jive
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a Starman waiting in the sky <br /> He'd like to come and meet us <br />
      But he thinks he'd blow our minds
    </p>
    <p>
      There's a Starman waiting in the sky <br />
      He's told us not to blow it <br />
      'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile, he told me <br /> Let the children lose it
      <br />
      Let the children use it <br />
      Let all the children boogie
    </p>
    <p>
      I had to phone someone, so I picked on you <br />
      Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too? <br />
      Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two
    </p>
    <p>
      Look out your window, I can see his light <br />
      If we can sparkle, he may land tonight <br />
      Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright
    </p>
    <p>
